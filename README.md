// project creates basic peg game with two boards, one being the changing board
// the other being the "coordinates" basically how the user can change it
// peg game allows user to jump pegs over other pegs to land on a '.'
// if the pegs are too far away the jump won't work
// if the user inputs letters not on the board the project asks for reinupt.
